# Fizz Buzz

The rules of _Fizz Buzz_ are really straightforward:

* When a number is divisible by three (3) `Fizz` is output
* When a number is divisible by five (5) `Buzz` is output
* When a number is divisible by three (3) _and_  five (5) then `FizzBuzz` is output

Otherwise the number itself is output.

E.g. `1`, `2`, `Fizz`, `4`, `Buzz`...

## Tasks

1. Create a console application that prints out the numbers `1` to `100`, applying the rules of _Fizz Buzz_
2. Extend your console application to accept new low and high boundary numbers, if the numbers are not provided the application should default to using `1` for the low boundary and `100` for the high boundary

## Unit tests

A [Unit test project](FizzBuzz.Tests) with a [single test](FizzBuzz.Tests/GetOutputTests.cs) has been provided. If possible provide tests that prove the correctness of your code.
