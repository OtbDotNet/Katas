# Submission guidelines

If you've been asked to do one of our Katas we try and ask as little as possible, however please make sure to follow these guidelines. Submissions that do not follow them will not be considered:

* We want you to submit your code via a public code repository such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/). If you want to host it somewhere else, that's fine, but please do not link us to a zip (or other archive) of code, we will not review this.
  * As an added bonus _do lots of commits_! This helps us to understand how you have arrived at your solution.
* Please only submit code that is buildable and shows _you_ to the _best of your abilities_.
* If your code requires special setup to build and run, please include instructions in a _readme.md_.

And finally...

* We deliberately do not specify a language/technology for our code tests as they are your opportunity to dazzle us, but bear in mind that we are predominantly a .NET team.
