## Introduction and CV discussion

During this phase of the interview we will be discussing your knowledge of [On The Beach](https://www.onthebeach.co.uk), and your work history based on your CV.

## Kata

Currently we use two Katas. We use the [FizzBuzz Kata](/FizzBuzz/readme.md) with people who we feel to be still developing their skills as software engineers. For more advanced software engineers we use the [Checkout kata](checkout.md).

In all cases the aim of the kata is to help us understand a number of things:

* What actually is your level of skill? (it turns out CVs give us a rough pointer, but not a full picture)
* How do you work with other people?
* What is your experience level with TDD?

This is your opportunity to really shine and show us what you can do.

The idea of doing the kata _is not_ to reach a complete solution.

We will be supplying a laptop to work on, with Visual Studio and Resharper. We use git (specifically GitHub Enterprise) internally, so we would like you to use git. If you don't currently use a source control tool don't worry.
